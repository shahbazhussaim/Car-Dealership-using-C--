# **Car Dealership Management System**

## **Introduction**
The Car Dealership Management System is a C++ program that allows users to **buy** or **rent cars**. It includes a collection of car categories, handles customer data, and generates invoices for both purchase and rental transactions.

---

## **Features**
1. **Buy a Car:**
   - Users can browse different categories of cars.
   - View car names, models, and prices.
   - Select a car to buy.
   - Generate an invoice for the purchase.

2. **Rent a Car:**
   - Users can browse car categories available for rent.
   - View details like car models, daily rent, and fuel efficiency.
   - Specify the number of days for rent.
   - Generate an invoice for the rental.

3. **Invoice Generation:**
   - Invoices include customer information, car details, price, and rental duration (if applicable).
   - Invoices are displayed in the console and saved to a file (`Invoice.txt`).

4. **Categories of Cars:**
   - **Sedan**
   - **SUV**
   - **Comfort (Luxury Cars)**

---

## **Files**
- **cars.txt**: Contains the car categories.
- **Invoice.txt**: Stores the generated invoice for download.

---

## **How to Use**
1. **Run the Program**: 
   - Compile and execute the program in a C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio) or a terminal using a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`).

2. **Choose an Action**:
   - On startup, youâ€™ll see two main options:
     - **1. Buy a Car**
     - **2. Rent a Car**

3. **Select a Category**:
   - Choose a car category by entering the corresponding number:
     - **1: Sedan**
     - **2: SUV**
     - **3: Comfort (Luxury Cars)**

4. **Make a Choice**:
   - If buying:
     - Select a car by entering its letter (a, b, c).
   - If renting:
     - Select a car by entering its letter (a, b, c) and specify the rental duration (number of days).

5. **Enter Customer Information**:
   - Provide your **name**, **CNIC**, and **phone number** when prompted.

6. **View and Save Invoice**:
   - The program will display the invoice on the console and save it to `Invoice.txt`.

---

## **Key Functions**
1. **`main()`**:
   - Handles the main menu and user actions.
   - Calls appropriate functions for purchase or rental.

2. **`Userchoice(char c)`**:
   - Displays cars for purchase based on the selected category.

3. **`Userchoice1(char c)`**:
   - Displays cars for rent based on the selected category.

4. **`pur()`**:
   - Generates an invoice for car purchases and saves it to `Invoice.txt`.

5. **`rent()`**:
   - Generates an invoice for car rentals and saves it to `Invoice.txt`.

6. **`UserInfo()`**:
   - Captures user information (name, CNIC, phone number).

---

## **Code Structure**
### Variables:
- **Customer Information:**
  - `name`, `cnic`, `phno`: Store customer details.
  
- **Car Details:**
  - `NC` (Car Name), `Pr` (Price for Purchase), `Pr1` (Price for Rent), `Md` (Model), `Fa` (Fuel Average).

- **Predefined Car Collections:**
  - Sedan, SUV, Comfort categories with car names, models, prices, and fuel averages.

---

## **Dependencies**
- **File I/O**:
  - Reads categories from `cars.txt`.
  - Writes invoices to `Invoice.txt`.

- **Libraries Used**:
  - `<iostream>` for input and output.
  - `<string>` for handling text.
  - `<fstream>` for file handling.
  - `<iomanip>` for formatting invoices.

---

## **Future Improvements**
- Add a **database** to manage car details and customer records.
- Provide an **administrative interface** to add or remove cars.
- Add **error handling** for invalid inputs.
- Implement a **graphical user interface (GUI)**.
- Introduce payment options and advanced invoicing features.

---

## **Known Issues**
- No validation for invalid inputs (e.g., wrong characters, invalid CNIC format).
- Static car information; no dynamic updates from the file.
- Limited categories and cars.

---

## **Conclusion**
The Car Dealership Management System is a basic implementation of a dealership system for managing purchases and rentals. It effectively demonstrates key programming concepts such as **file handling**, **classical I/O operations**, and **decision-making structures**.
